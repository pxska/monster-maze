# Monster Maze
A Python game

### NB! The game requires PyGame and EasyGUI.

This was a project I created as the project for my Python class. The project had two separate versions -
the first version was a number-guessing game and the second version was the maze game. I put those two
together and made a monster-maze, where if you stumble upon a coloured square, then you get a popup
(made with EasyGUI) to guess a number correctly. You have three tries and the popup also tells you if
you're close or far away from the correct answer. If you win, you get to continue, if you lose all three tries
then the game ends.

I can see how this could be developed even further, for example, creating more monsters with different abilities,
classes and such as well as implementing a life-based system. I could also make the maze more difficult and such.
